            <p>Kia Ora, I&#39;m Jefritz, a creative UX designer studying at Media Design School, & based in Auckland. 
                <br> <br>
                I am passionate about creating and delivering impactful design that benefits the community. There&#39;s something significant when designing products that benefit and solve real world problems that can create an impact for a wide range of communities in the future. Empathy is one of my values & it has led me to foster a deeper interest in UX design in understanding and prioritising user&#39;s wants and needs. Challenges, variety & experimentation are always welcomed because that means growth is being done - alongside this, I&#39;m always eager and open to learn new skills. <br> <br>
                Aside from my passion in being a UX designer, I am also skilled in coding, UI and drawing cute little doodles but I am always seeking new learning opportunities to expand my creative skillset.</p>
