            <h3>UX/UI DESIGNER</h3>
            <br>
            <p class="bio-paragraph">Kia Ora, I&#39;m Jefritz, a creative designer studying at Media Design School, &
                based in Auckland.
                <br> <br>
                I am passionate about creating and delivering impactful design that benefits the community. There&#39;s
                something significant when designing products that benefit and solve real world problems that can create
                an impact for a wide range of communities in the future.
                Challenges, variety & experimentation are always welcomed because that means growth is being done -
                alongside this, I&#39;m always eager and open to learn new skills. <br> <br>
                Aside from my passion in being a UX designer, I am also skilled in coding, and drawing
                but I am always seeking new learning opportunities to expand my creative skillset.

            <h3>connection</h3>
            <p>Design is about connection, connecting ideas, connecting people, connecting communities. Each design project and process to me is about conversations, laughs and a shared sense of values. It is important to me to design with a sense of connection to people and creating long-lasting relationships with the people I work with.</p>

            <h3>empathy</h3>
            <p>When we design, we are designing for people. Therefore, it is important to design with empathy in mind, understanding the needs, emotions and challenges of every person that is involved in each project. Ensuring that their perspectives and experiences are reflected and heard through the solutions created.</p>
        </div><div></div>
        <div>
            <h3>growth</h3>
            <p>Design is an ever-evolving subject. Each project is designed with care and purpose, hoping to influence growth, whether it&#39;s a website, brand, or campaign.  In a personal aspect, I create with the intent to grow my skills by taking on new challenges, coming out of my comfort zone and trying new things. </p>
        </div><div></div>
        <div>
            <h3>impact</h3>
            <p>Impact is IMPORTANT. It evokes emotion, creates memories and leaves people thinking or leaving with a new perspective. This is the experience I want to create with each design project I create. Hoping to leave a memorable experience and impact on every person&#39;s mind that comes into contact with the projects.</p>
