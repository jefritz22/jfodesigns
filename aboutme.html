            <h3>UX/UI DESIGNER</h3>
            <br>
            <p class="bio-paragraph">Kia Ora, I&#39;m Jefritz, a creative designer studying at Media
                Design School, &
                based in Auckland.
                <br> <br>
                I am passionate about creating and delivering impactful design that benefits the community. There&#39;s
                something significant when designing products that benefit and solve real world problems that can create
                an impact for a wide range of communities in the future.
                Challenges, variety & experimentation are always welcomed because that means growth is being done.<br>
                <br>
                I specialise in UX/UI Design, but I am also skilled in coding, graphic design, and illustrating.
                However, it is important for me to always seeking new learning opportunities so I can expand my creative
                skillset. <br><br>

                Some soft skills I have are leadership, teaching, eager to learn and problem solving. These are shown
                through being a Young Adults leader at church, being selected for the We The Women Girl Boss Hackfest
                2025, working as an after-school care teacher for children interested in STEM, and volunteering in the
                lighting team for church where we face troubleshooting and have to problem solve each time. <br><br>

                My hard skills lie in the Adobe Software, Figma, Lightroom, HTML, CSS, JS, Scratch Coding, AI and Procreate.

            <h3>connection</h3>
            <p>Design is about connection, connecting ideas, people and communities. The relationships I have with the
                people I work with is built on trust, and respect. Alongside this, I ensure that my design connects
                communities through conversations and understanding.</p>
        </div>
        <div></div>
        <div>
            <h3>empathy</h3>
            <p>When we design, we are designing for people. I am committed to understanding the needs, emotions and
                challenges of every person that is involved in each project. Ensuring that their perspectives and
                experiences are reflected and heard through the solutions created.</p>
        </div>
        <div></div>
        <div>
            <h3>growth</h3>
            <p>Design is an ever-evolving subject.
                Each project is designed with care and purpose, hoping to
                influence growth, whether it&#39;s a website, brand, or campaign. In a personal aspect, I create
                with the intent to grow my skills by taking on new challenges, coming out of my comfort zone and
                trying new things. </p>
        </div>
        <div></div>
        <div>
            <h3>impact</h3>
            <p>Impact is IMPORTANT. It evokes emotion, creates memories and leaves people thinking or leaving
                with a new perspective. I strive to create this experience with each design project. Hoping to leave a
                memorable experience and impact on every person&#39;s mind that comes
                into contact with the projects.</p>
