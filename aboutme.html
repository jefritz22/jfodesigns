            <h3>UX/UI DESIGNER</h3>
            <br>
            <p class="bio-paragraph">Kia Ora, I&#39;m Jefritz, a Purpose-Driven UX/UI designer who is based in Auckland.
                <br> <br>
                I&#39;m passionate about crafting meaningful, impactful design that serves communities. It's important to me to deliver designs that solve real-world problems and create lasting change for a wide range of people.

                <br>
                <br>
                While I specialise in UX/UI design, I also have experience in front-end development and graphic design. I&#39;m always seeking new learning opportunities to grow my creative skillset — I welcome challenges, variety, and experimentation because they push me to evolve.<br><br>

                My soft skills include leadership, teaching, problem-solving, and a strong eagerness to learn. These qualities are evident in my work as a Young Adults and Production leader at church, being selected for the We The Women GirlBoss Hackfest 2025, teaching after-school STEM programmes, and being apart of the RUSH Digital Mentorship Program.<br><br>

            <h3>connection</h3>
            <p>Design is about connection, connecting ideas, people and communities. The relationships I have with the
                people I work with is built on trust, and respect. Alongside this, I ensure that my design connects
                communities through conversations and understanding.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>empathy</h3>
            <p>When we design, we are designing for people. I am committed to understanding the needs, emotions and
                challenges of every person that is involved in each project. Ensuring that their perspectives and
                experiences are reflected and heard through the solutions created.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>growth</h3>
            <p>Design is an ever-evolving subject.
                Each project is designed with care and purpose, hoping to
                influence growth, whether it&#39;s a website, brand, or campaign. In a personal aspect, I create
                with the intent to grow my skills by taking on new challenges, coming out of my comfort zone and
                trying new things. </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>impact</h3>
            <p>Impact is IMPORTANT. It evokes emotion, creates memories and leaves people thinking or leaving
                with a new perspective. I strive to create this experience with each design project. Hoping to leave a
                memorable experience and impact on every person&#39;s mind that comes
                into contact with the projects.</p>
