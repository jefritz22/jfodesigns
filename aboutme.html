            <br>
            <p class="bio-paragraph">Kia Ora, I&#39;m Jefritz, a creative designer studying at Media Design School, &
                based in Auckland.
                <br> <br>
                I am passionate about creating and delivering impactful design that benefits the community. There&#39;s
                something significant when designing products that benefit and solve real world problems that can create
                an impact for a wide range of communities in the future.
                Challenges, variety & experimentation are always welcomed because that means growth is being done -
                alongside this, I&#39;m always eager and open to learn new skills. <br> <br>
                Aside from my passion in being a UX designer, I am also skilled in coding, and drawing
                but I am always seeking new learning opportunities to expand my creative skillset.
