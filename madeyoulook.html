                <h3>BRIEF</h3>
                <p>For this brief, we worked with <b>
                    Sony
                        Music
                </b> to create a<b> brand identity and campaign</b> to attract and engage audiences for Made You Look.
                </p>
                <h3>SOLUTION</h3>
                <p>Our
                    objectives were to create branding that is loud, nostalgic and edgy, while creating a campaign that
                    resonated with Made You Look's message to their fans.</p>
                    <h3>CONTRIBUTION</h3>
            <p>In my role as a project manager, I was in charge of <b>managing the team and project's progress</b> through daily standups and project management tools. As the UX/UI Designer, I carried out<b> user research and user testing as well as co-designing the website</b>. I was also responsible for designing the interactive experience. As part of being the Developer, my responsibility was to <b>develop the website</b>.</p>

            <h3 class="headingtext">USER RESEARCH</h3>
            <p class="bodytext">User Research was an important part of this project as we are trying to build attraction towards Made You Look's debut album. Therefore, we investigated Made You Look's target audience through self-conducted surveys and interviews to find out <b>what engages fans </b>the most and how we can incorporate this into our project.</p>

            <h3 class="headingtext">INTERACTIVE EXPERIENCE</h3>
            <p class="bodytext">Through communication with the client, they provided a short description of how the duo
                met in a boxing
                gym and their values as a duo being <b>“to inspire people to chase their dreams.”</b> Combining these two
                ideas, we created an installation of a locker room photobooth where users can take a photo and answer a
                prompt to <b>inspire ambitions in their hearts</b>. This <b>
                    can be experienced both physically and, on the
                    website
                </b>, as they want to reach a target audience of not just New Zealand but also globally.</p>

            <h3 class="headingtext">USER TESTING</h3>
            <p class="bodytext">To ensure our prompt matched the Made You Look brand identity, we user tested different
                prompts and
                found that “Where do you want to be 2 years from now?” invoked the <b>most hopeful feelings</b>, was the
                <b>easiest to answer</b> and <b>made people feel wishful</b>. <br>
