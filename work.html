                        <p class="text">Arcadia is a recruitment campaign that destigmatises and uplifts rural healthcare. Our team looked at helping nurses looking to work rurally overcome barriers and defeat the stigmas that they may come across. This was a group project that looked at how to make healthcare more accessible to our fellow New Zealanders.
