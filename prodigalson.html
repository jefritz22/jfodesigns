            <p>The Bible consists of 1,189 chapters of ancient text that sum up the Christian faith. In the present day,
                there is now a variety of media like podcasts, videos, and comics to help people consume information,
                but the Bible lacks these resources. Therefore, my design challenge was “How can we use scrollytelling
                to help young visual learners understand the Bible better?” This project was an experimental project
                that investigated a series of 5 experiments to deliver the outcome.</p>

            <h3 class="headingtext">USER INSIGHTS</h3>
            <p class="bodytext">
                Through self-conducted interviews and surveys, I had two challenges: 1&#41; What visual direction
                attracts
                and engages our target audience & 2&#41; Which stories in the Bible do people find hard to grasp and
                understand? <br> <br>
                &#8208; Geometric art style is simple and less distracting <br>
                &#8208; Immersive and aesthetically pleasing to look at for users <br>
                &#8208; Peaceful and vibrant <br>
                &#8208; Minimalistic and clean, making it easier to understand. <br>
                &#8208; Imagining and visualising it in my head helps me to understand the context more <br>
                &#8208; The parables are not always fully understood and having illustrations would be helpful <br>
                &#8208; The parables are the hardest to decipher <br>
                &#8208; The parables are difficult to imagine, so having visual aids would help <br>
                &#8208; Reading the parables can be confusing <br>
                &#8208; A lot of the parables are metaphorical and need physical diagrams</p>

            <h3 class="headingtext">EXPERIMENT: STORYBOARD</h3>
            <p class="bodytext">Through creating the website and
                story, I carefully considered how the illustrations are arranged so that the parables are not
                misinterpreted or misleading. After some considerable research, it was clear that my original storyboard
                lacked a variety in compositions. Therefore, refinements were made to incorporate a range of
                compositions to keep the story engaging and interesting.</p>

            <h3 class="headingtext">EXPERIMENT: VISUAL DIRECTION</h3>
            <p class="bodytext">
                Through experimentation and user testing, I simplified the typefaces used and chose typefaces that was used in traditional Bible books to immerse our users as if they are reading the Bible. <br>
                The Bible was set in ancient times and in the desert&#59; therefore, the colour palette was chosen to
                reflect earthy tones that worked harmoniously together.

            <h3 class="headingtext">DEVELOPMENT</h3>
            <p class="bodytext">After the experiments, the next step was refining the project based on the insights and observations.
                Through some research, I found that coding through GSAP was the most effective way of scrollytelling
                animations. This project
                focused primarily on learning skills in scrollytelling and illustrations, but if it were to continue in
                the future, features would be added such as voiceover audio, summaries of scripture, and progress bars.
            </p>

            <p>Scrollytelling is an interesting and effective technique that can be investigated more to help visual
                learners read through long pieces of text. It can also be an effective media that can be explored for
                reading and understanding the Bible. This is showcased through the final project that shows the
                interaction of scrollytelling and storytelling to convey the parable of the Prodigal Son.
