                <p>An experimental passion project based on the Bible. <br>How can I use <b>scrollytelling</b> to help young visual learners understand the Bible better?
                </p>
                <h3>SOLUTION</h3>
                <p>Through the use of scrollytelling techniques combined with visual illustrations and text.</p>

            <h3 class="headingtext">USER INSIGHTS</h3>
            <p class="bodytext">
                I had a challenge of figuring out what stories users would want visualised, therefore, I conducted interviews and surveys to investigate this.<br> <br>
                &#8208; "The parables are not always fully understood and having illustrations would be helpful" <br>
                &#8208; "The parables are the <b>hardest to decipher</b>"" <br>
                &#8208; "The parables are <b>difficult to imagine</b>, so having visual aids would help" <br>
                &#8208; "Reading the parables can be <b>confusing</b>" <br>
                &#8208; "A lot of the parables are metaphorical and need physical diagrams"</p>

<img src="images/quotesparable.jpg" alt="User insight quotes about the parables">

            <h3 class="headingtext">EXPERIMENT: STORYBOARD</h3>
            <p class="bodytext">Through creating the website and
                story, I carefully considered how the illustrations are arranged so that the parables are not
                misinterpreted or misleading. After some considerable research, it was clear that my original storyboard
                <b>lacked a variety in compositions</b>. Therefore, <b>
                    refinements were made to incorporate a range of
                    compositions to keep the story engaging and interesting.
                </b></p>

            <h3 class="headingtext">EXPERIMENT: VISUAL DIRECTION</h3>
            <p class="bodytext">
                Through experimentation and user testing, I <b>simplified</b> the typefaces used and chose typefaces that was used in traditional Bible books to <b>immerse our users as if they are reading the Bible</b>. <br>
                The Bible was set in ancient times and in the desert&#59; therefore, the colour palette was chosen to
                reflect earthy tones that worked harmoniously together.

            <h3 class="headingtext">DEVELOPMENT</h3>
            <p class="bodytext">After the experiments, the next step was refining the project based on the insights and observations.
                Through some research, I found that coding through GSAP was the most effective way of scrollytelling
                animations. This project
                <b>focused primarily on learning skills in scrollytelling and illustrations</b>, but if it were to continue in
                the future, <b>features would be added such as voiceover audio, summaries of scripture, and progress bars</b>.
            </p>

            <p>Scrollytelling is an interesting and effective technique that can be investigated more to help visual
                learners read through long pieces of text. <b>
                    It can also be an effective media that can be explored for
                    reading and understanding the Bible
                </b>. This is showcased through the final project that shows the
                interaction of scrollytelling and storytelling to convey the parable of the Prodigal Son.
