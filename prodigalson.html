            <p>The Bible consists of 1,189 chapters of ancient text that sum up the Christian faith. In the present day,
                there is now a variety of media like podcasts, videos, and comics to help people consume information,
                but the Bible lacks these resources. Therefore, my design challenge was “How can we use scrollytelling
                to help young visual learners understand the Bible better?” This project was an experimental project
                that investigated a series of 5 experiments to deliver the outcome.</p>


            <h3>RESEARCH</h3>
            <p class="bodytext">Scrollytelling has become an
                important method for using long, narrative texts to tell complex stories in an interesting and engaging
                way. It uses a variety of elements like images, audio, video content and typography to enhance the
                story. Scrollytelling can be more personal and intimate while also creating an emotional connection with
                the reader. By combining these subjects in mind, it helped support my project.</p>

            <h3 class="headingtext">USER RESEARCH</h3>
            <p class="bodytext">Through self-conducted interviews and surveys, I had two challenges: 1&#41; What visual direction
                attracts
                and engages our target audience & 2&#41; Which stories in the Bible do people find hard to grasp and
                understand?
                For the first point, I sent out a poll between a cartoon and geometric art style, and geometric was a
                clear winner. The tone of voice for the project was simple, engaging, and easy to understand, and the
                geometric art style highly matched this. The geometric art style I used was highly inspired by the Bible
                Project and Riccardo Guasco. For my second challenge, users gave feedback saying that the Parables were
                the hardest stories for people to understand, as well as being a story that people want visualised.
                Therefore, I chose to focus on one of the most famous parables in the Bible, The Prodigal Son.
            </p>

            <h3>USER INSIGHTS</h3>
            <p class="bodytext">
                &#8208; Geometric art style is simple and less distracting <br>
                &#8208; Immersive and aesthetically pleasing to look at for users <br>
                &#8208; Peaceful and vibrant <br>
                &#8208; Minimalistic and clean, making it easier to understand. <br>
                &#8208; Imagining and visualising it in my head helps me to understand the context more <br>
                &#8208; The parables are not always fully understood and having illustrations would be helpful <br>
                &#8208; The parables are the hardest to decipher <br>
                &#8208; The parables are difficult to imagine, so having visual aids would help <br>
                &#8208; Reading the parables can be confusing <br>
                &#8208; A lot of the parables are metaphorical and need physical diagrams</p>

            <h3 class="headingtext">EXPERIMENT: STORYBOARD</h3>
            <p class="bodytext">Taking the Prodigal Son parable, I started off by doing storyboarding. Through creating the website and
                story, I carefully considered how the illustrations are arranged so that the parables are not
                misinterpreted or misleading. After some considerable research, it was clear that my original storyboard
                lacked a variety in compositions. Therefore, refinements were made to incorporate a range of
                compositions to keep the story engaging and interesting.</p>

            <h3 class="headingtext">EXPERIMENT: VISUAL DIRECTION</h3>
            <p class="bodytext">
                For the typography, I initially started off with using a modern, easy-to-read typeface paired with a
                script typeface. After some user testing and feedback, using a range of typefaces for one scene was
                ineffective as it took away from the illustrations and distracted people from the scene. Through further
                investigation, users also suggested using typography from the Bible to immerse and associate the website
                as if they were reading the Bible. Therefore, through some research, I paired Garamond, a popular
                typeface used in traditional Bibles, with Helvetica, a sans-serif typeface used in modern or digital
                Bibles, to create a pairing that is timeless, immersive and has high readability. <br>
                The Bible was set in ancient times and in the desert&#59; therefore, the colour palette was chosen to
                reflect earthy tones that worked harmoniously together. Using this colour palette, I created a range of
                illustrations to showcase the Prodigal Son parable.

            <h3>DEVELOPMENT</h3>
            <p class="bodytext">After the experiments, the next step was refining the project based on the insights and observations.
                Through some research, I found that coding through GSAP was the most effective way of scrollytelling
                animations. Because this was an experimental project, the outcome consisted of three scenes from the
                storyboard and displayed scrollytelling techniques to captivate and engage the audience. This project
                focused primarily on learning skills in scrollytelling and illustrations, but if it were to continue in
                the future, features would be added such as voiceover audio, summaries of scripture, progress bars, and
                definitions of words.
            </p>

            <p>Scrollytelling is an interesting and effective technique that can be investigated more to help visual
                learners read through long pieces of text. It can also be an effective media that can be explored for
                reading and understanding the Bible. This is showcased through the final project that shows the
                interaction of scrollytelling and storytelling to convey the parable of the Prodigal Son.
