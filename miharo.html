                <h3>BRIEF</h3>
                <p>This was a project working with <b>Auckland Museum</b> to design a web-based experience that lets
                    children and families explore and engage with the Weird and Wonderful Exhibition beyond the physical
                    space.
                </p>
                <h3>SOLUTION</h3>
                <p>We created a an emotional narrative game about a Takahē who looks to the Māori gods for help as she
                    wants the ability to fly. <b>It invites storytelling, education, interactivity with Te Ao Māori.</b>
                </p>
                <h3>CONTRIBUTION</h3>
                <p>As a Project Manager, I ensured that our team's goals were met each week, that we were holding daily standups and that tasks were delegated. As the Creative Director, I ensured that all visual collateral was cohesive and represented our brand well. For this project, <b>I created all the prototyping, story narrative, and dialogue of each character.</b></p>

            <h3 class="headingtext">STORYTELLING</h3>
            <p class="bodytext">When creating the story, it was important to <b>create a narrative that engaged our tamariki and helped them learn through play</b>. The story was easy to follow with one clear goal: Helping the Takahe to fly. This ensured that our tamariki would not be confused. Our storytelling incorporated Te Ao Māori with the Weird and Wonderful exhibition to further include Auckland Museum's values.

            <h3 class="headingtext">UI DESIGN</h3>
            <p class="bodytext"><b>Consistency</b> and <b>cohesiveness</b> were an important part of our project. We needed to ensure that our UI was all consistent; therefore, I created a simple design system to help us keep consistent when it came to designing and developing the interactive experience. It was also important for our <b>UI to contrast well with the background</b> so that the children could easily spot any buttons they needed to press.
            </p>

            <h3 class="headingtext">ACCESSIBILITY</h3>
            <p class="bodytext">We highly valued accessibility when it came to this project; therefore, <b>we designed the experience for a range of devices</b>: iPad, desktop and phone. Alongside this, we had <b>voiceovers for every dialogue with the option of replaying dialogue</b>, to cater to children who have difficulty reading. <b>The dialogue was simple, straightforward and included simple Māori words to enhance learning</b>. We wanted our project to be accessible to a range of children.

            <h3 class="headingtext">DESIGNING FOR KIDS</h3>
            <p class="bodytext">Since our project was targeted towards kids, our UI, tutorials and games had to be <b>simple, engaging, easy to understand and fun.</b> This is so that the children will want to play and will not get frustrated if the games are too challenging. We wanted the tamariki to have fun, direct the game, but still feel accomplished after playing the game. We wanted the <b>games to be revisited and replayable</b>, therefore, we made the games fun and straightforward for the children to want to come back to the website.
